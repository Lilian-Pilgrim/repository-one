      <p>Have you ever been in a moment of your life where you felt nor here nor there? <br><br>Well, you would be surprised to learn that that is more common than you think.<br><br> <!A lot of us are not  in touch with how we feel regarding to our emotions.> In fact, a lot of us are not even in touch with how we feel about our next meal, let alone how we feel in relation to the small or big “staff” of our feelings.<br><br>
    So, what to do when you know that inside something is not quite working but you cannot put your finger on what it is or rather on what it is not?<br><br>
    That is where nature can help us. Nope, you don’t need to borough your relative 70<sup>s</sup> outfit and starting hugging trees or give up your morning trip to your local coffee shop. Dr Edward Bach, a London based doctor in the 30<sup>s</sup>, has simplified  life for you.<br><br>
    Dr Bach develop a healing system using flower found in nature that work with different state of our emotional mind. More about that later.

      <p>Dr Bach believed that when we feel a certain way that is a reflection of our mind. That is whe have a state of mind<br><br>

      so if we feel despondent and not wanting to complete a that task that we keep procrastination about, all we need is to much a remedy or essence that eliminates of our mind the procrastination<br><br> </p>
