            This site is designed to help you find solutions for your physical, mental and spiritual health and well-being.<br><br>

            And, yes! You can still have a "normal" life, including your daily cup of coffe, and still feel well balanced.<br><br>

           As a child I remember my mother treating us for the day-to-day illness with natural remedies. If we had a cold there would be a strong tea of garlic, onion and raw honey for us to drink. Yep, no laughing matter about that one.<br><br>
    For the relieve of my teenage son and some of us, the alternative world has moved along way in the last 35 years or so!<br><br>

    Cold and flu apart, I think, more than ever, a lot of us have become more interested in the emotional and spiritual mind behind the physical symptoms or hindering behaviour we experience either within ourselves or in our loved ones.<br><br>
