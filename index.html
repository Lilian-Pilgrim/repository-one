          <p>
            This site is designed to help you to find out more about alternative solutions for your physical, mental and spiritual health and well-being. <br><br>
    As a child I remember my mother treating us for the day-to-day illness with natural remedies. If we had a cold there would be a strong tea of garlic, onion and raw honey for us to drink. Yep, no laughing matter about that one. <br<br>
    For the relieve of my teenage son and some of us, the alternative world has moved along way in the last 35 years or so!<br><br>
    Cold and flu apart, I think is fair to say that more than ever a lot of us become more interested in the emotional and spiritual mind behind the physical symptoms or hindering behaviour that some of us has encountered either within ourselves or in our loved ones. <br><br>
